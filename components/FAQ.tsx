  },
  {
    question: "How long until I see results?",

    question: "Do I need to know about tech?",
    answer: "Not at all! We handle everything for you. You'll get simple tools that are easy to use, plus clear training and support whenever you need it."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost?",
    answer: "We start with a $500 plan that shows you exactly how to save time in your business. After that, projects typically cost $2,500-$10,000, depending on what you need. Many clients also choose our monthly support plan ($500-$1,500) to keep improving their tools."
  },
  {
    question: "When will I start saving time?",
    answer: "Most clients save 5-10 hours per week within the first month. We'll show you exactly how much time you'll save during our free strategy call."
  },
  {
    question: "What types of businesses do you work with?",
    answer: "We work with service businesses like agencies, consultants, coaches, and trades. If you spend time on repetitive tasks or customer service, we can help you automate that work."
